Assignment 3 — Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim & Kruskal)

Student: Ansar Keles
University: Astana IT University
Course: Design and Analytics of algorithms
Date: October 2025


#Project Overview

This project implements Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of weighted graphs.
It simulates optimizing a city transportation network by minimizing road construction costs while keeping all points connected.


#Project Structure

src/main/java/ → Java source code
data/ → Input graph datasets (JSON)
results/ → Output results (JSON + CSV)
Assignment3_Report.pdf → Final report
pom.xml → Maven configuration file

#How to Run

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (as a Maven project)
Run the class: mst.Main
The program will generate:
Assik3/ass_3_output.json — detailed results
results/summary.csv — summary table

#Analysis
Both algorithms yield the same MST total cost → correctness confirmed ✅
Prim’s algorithm performs slightly faster on dense graphs.
Kruskal’s algorithm performs better on sparse graphs, though with more edge comparisons.
Complexities:

Prim — O(V²)
Kruskal — O(E log E)
